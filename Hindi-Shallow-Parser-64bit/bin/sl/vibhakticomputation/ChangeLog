	* Version 2.2.1

	1. Position of the vibhakti is noted down.
	Ex: Previously vpos="vib_2_RP_4" now vpos="vib1_2_RP_4"

19-3-2009  Avinesh PVS  <avinesh@students.iiit.ac.in>,<avinesh.pvs@gmail.com>

	* Version 2.2
	
	1. RP's and PSP's, NEG's and VAUX's position being stored in a
	variable called vpos. (examples in error.rin)

	Input:
	1       ((      VGF     <fs af='Cipa,v,m,sg,any,,wA,wA' head="CipawA">
	1.1     nahIM   NEG     <fs af='nahIM,adv,,,,,,' poslcat="NM">
	1.2     CipawA  VM      <fs af='Cipa,v,m,sg,any,,wA,wA' name="CipawA">
	1.3     hE      VAUX    <fs af='hE,v,any,sg,2,,hE,hE' name="hE">
		))
	Output:
	1       ((      VGF     <fs af='Cipa,v,m,sg,2,,nahIM_wA_hE,wA' head="CipawA" vpos="NEG1_tam2_3">
	1.1     CipawA  VM      <fs af='Cipa,v,m,sg,any,,wA,wA' name="CipawA">
		))

	Here vpos represents NEG1_tam_3 -> "NEG1" position of NEG is 1,"tam"
	is original tam of the head at 2 after addition of NEG,3 represents the position of hE.

	This is given to have the flexibility of the position in the Vibhakti
	Splitter Module.
